This study demonstrates the effectiveness of different multiple testing correction
methods in identifying differentially expressed genes in leukemiaâ€™s microarray
gene expression data. The choice of method impacts the number of significant
genes discovered, with the FDR method providing a balance between sensitivity
and specificity. Visualizing the results offers additional insights into the data
distribution and variability, highlighting the importance of graphical analysis in
bioinformatics research
